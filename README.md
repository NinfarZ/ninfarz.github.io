I wanted this page to have a striking contrast between the light and dark themes. A mood change of sorts. 
Whereas the light theme feels like a sunny day, the dark theme is more ominous and abstract.
I also wanted pixel art to blend into the mix, and made it so the images themselves would switch to fit the current theme.

This was built with vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS.
